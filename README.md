# PDCProject

The goal of this project is to transmit a text using sound. The emitter takes a text file, converts it to sound and emits it using the speakers.
The receiver listens to the sound, saves it and processes it to extract the text. 
Between the emitter and the receiver there is source of white noise emitting on every possible frequencies except the bandwidth 1khz-2khz or 2khz-3khz. The bandwidth exception is chosen randomly and is unknown by the receiver and the emitter.
